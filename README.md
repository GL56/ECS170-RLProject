# Atari Pong Reinforcement Learning  
ECS 170 FQ 2025  
Group Project  

## Overview  
In this project, we worked on reinforcement learning agents that attempted to learn a good policy when playing Atari Pong. Our group utilized three different algorithms. First one is a Deep Q-Network algorithm. Second one is a State-Action-Reward-State-Action algorithm. Third one is Linear Function Approximation with Gradient-Free Control algorithm.

## Project Code  
The repository is split into 4 branches: main, team1, team2, team3.  
Each branch has their corresponding agent code.  
Team 1 - DQN Agent  
Team 2 - SARSA Agent  
Team 3 - LFA Agent
